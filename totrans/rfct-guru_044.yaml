- en: If you're skimping on the number of variables inside a function and reusing
    them for various unrelated purposes, you're sure to encounter problems as soon
    as you need to make changes to the code containing the variables. You will have
    to recheck each case of variable use to make sure that the correct values are
    used.

    only. This makes it much easier to maintain the code, since you can easily replace
    any particular thing without fear of unintended effects.

    probably has a name that doesn''t explain anything: `k`, `a2`, `value`, etc. But
    you can fix this situation by naming the new variables in an understandable, self-explanatory
    way. Such names might resemble `customerTaxValue`, `cityUnemploymentRate`, `clientSalutationString`
    and the like.'

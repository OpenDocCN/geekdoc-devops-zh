- en: A message chain occurs when a client requests another object, that object requests
    yet another one, and so on. These chains mean that the client is dependent on
    navigation along the class structure. Any changes in these relationships require
    modifying the client.

- en: Sometimes it's better to think of why the end object is being used. Perhaps
    it would make sense to use [Extract Method](/extract-method) for this functionality
    and move it to the beginning of the chain, by using [Move Method](/move-method).

- en: Overly aggressive delegate hiding can cause code in which it's hard to see where
    the functionality is actually occurring. Which is another way of saying, avoid
    the [Middle Man](/smells/middle-man) smell as well.

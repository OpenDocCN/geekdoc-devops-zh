    <p>Even if you have distributed functionality among different classes in a less-than-perfect way, there's still hope.</p>
<p>These refactoring techniques show how to safely move functionality between classes, create new classes, and hide implementation details from public access.</p>
<div class="relations link-list">
  <div class="dl"><div class="dt"><a href="/move-method">Move Method</a></div><div class="dd">
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> A method is used more in another class than in its own class.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Create a new method in the class that uses the method the most, then move code from the old method to there. Turn the code of the original method into a reference to the new method in the other class or else remove it entirely.</p>
</div></div>
  <div class="dl"><div class="dt"><a href="/move-field">Move Field</a></div><div class="dd">
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> A field is used more in another class than in its own class.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Create a field in a new class and redirect all users of the old field to it.</p>
</div></div>
  <div class="dl"><div class="dt"><a href="/extract-class">Extract Class</a></div><div class="dd">
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> When one class does the work of two, awkwardness results.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Instead, create a new class and place the fields and methods responsible for the relevant functionality in it.</p>
</div></div>
  <div class="dl"><div class="dt"><a href="/inline-class">Inline Class</a></div><div class="dd">
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> A class does almost nothing and isn't responsible for anything, and no additional responsibilities are planned for it.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Move all features from the class to another one.</p>
</div></div>
  <div class="dl"><div class="dt"><a href="/hide-delegate">Hide Delegate</a></div><div class="dd">
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> The client gets object B from a field or method of object А. Then the client calls a method of object B.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Create a new method in class A that delegates the call to object B. Now the client doesn't know about, or depend on, class B.</p>
</div></div>
  <div class="dl"><div class="dt"><a href="/remove-middle-man">Remove Middle Man</a></div><div class="dd">
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> A class has too many methods that simply delegate to other objects.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Delete these methods and force the client to call the end methods directly.</p>
</div></div>
  <div class="dl"><div class="dt"><a href="/introduce-foreign-method">Introduce Foreign Method</a></div><div class="dd">
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> A utility class doesn't contain the method that you need and you can't add the method to the class.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Add the method to a client class and pass an object of the utility class to it as an argument.</p>
</div></div>
  <div class="dl"><div class="dt"><a href="/introduce-local-extension">Introduce Local Extension</a></div><div class="dd">
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> A utility class doesn't contain some methods that you need. But you can't add these methods to the class.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Create a new class containing the methods and make it either the child or wrapper of the utility class.</p>

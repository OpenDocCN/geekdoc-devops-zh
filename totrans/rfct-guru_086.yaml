    should return the value and the other one modifies the object.

- en: This factoring technique implements *Command and Query Responsibility Segregation*.
    This principle tells us to separate code responsible for getting data from code
    that changes something inside an object.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Code for getting data is named a *query*. Code for changing things in the *visible
    state* of an object is named a *modifier*. When a *query* and *modifier* are combined,
    you don't have a way to get data without making changes to its condition. In other
    words, you ask a question and can change the answer even as it's being received.
    This problem becomes even more severe when the person calling the query may not
    know about the method's "side effects", which often leads to runtime errors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But remember that side effects are dangerous only in the case of *modifiers*
    that change the **visible** state of an object. These could be, for example, fields
    accessible from an object's public interface, entry in a database, in files, etc.
    If a *modifier* only caches a complex operation and saves it within the private
    field of a class, it can hardly cause any side effects.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have a *query* that doesn't change the state of your program, you can
    call it as many times as you like without having to worry about unintended changes
    in the result caused by the mere fact of you calling the method.

    when deleting something from a database you want to know how many rows were deleted.

- en: Change the original method so that it returns only the result of calling the
    new *query method*.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Replace all references to the original method with a call to the *query method*.
    Immediately before this line, place a call to the *modifier method*. This will
    save you from side effects in case if the original method was used in a condition
    of a conditional operator or loop.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Get rid of the value-returning code in the original method, which now has become
    a proper *modifier method*.

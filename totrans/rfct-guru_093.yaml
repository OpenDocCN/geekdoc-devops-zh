  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Quite often, the need to hide methods for getting and setting values is due
    to development of a richer interface that provides additional behavior, especially
    if you started with a class that added little beyond mere data encapsulation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As new behavior is built into the class, you may find that public getter and
    setter methods are no longer necessary and can be hidden. If you make getter or
    setter methods private and apply direct access to variables, you can delete the
    method.

- en: Hiding methods makes it easier for your code to evolve. When you change a private
    method, you only need to worry about how to not break the current class since
    you know that the method can't be used anywhere else.

    of the class and of the methods that remain public.

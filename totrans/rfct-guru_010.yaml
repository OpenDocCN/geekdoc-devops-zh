- en: As is the case with long methods as well, programmers usually find it mentally
    less taxing to place a new feature in an existing class than to create a new class
    for the feature.

- en: If a large class is responsible for the graphical interface, you may try to
    move some of its data and behavior to a separate domain object. In doing so, it
    may be necessary to store copies of some data in two places and keep the data
    consistent. [Duplicate Observed Data](/duplicate-observed-data) offers a way to
    do this.

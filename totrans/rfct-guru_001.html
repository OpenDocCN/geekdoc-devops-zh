    <p>The main purpose of refactoring is to fight technical debt. It transforms a mess into clean code and simple design.</p>
<p>Nice! But what's clean code, anyway? Here are some of its features:</p>
<h4><i class="fa fa-shower" aria-hidden="true"/> Clean code is obvious for other programmers.</h4>
<p>And I'm not talking about super sophisticated algorithms. Poor variable naming, bloated classes and methods, magic numbers -you name it- all of that makes code sloppy and difficult to grasp.</p>
<h4><i class="fa fa-shower" aria-hidden="true"/> Clean code doesn't contain duplication.</h4>
<p>Each time you have to make a change in a duplicate code, you have to remember to make the same change to every instance. This increases the cognitive load and slows down the progress.</p>
<h4><i class="fa fa-shower" aria-hidden="true"/> Clean code contains a minimal number of classes and other moving parts.</h4>
<p>Less code is less stuff to keep in your head. Less code is less maintenance. Less code is fewer bugs. Code is liability, keep it short and simple.</p>
<h4><i class="fa fa-shower" aria-hidden="true"/> Clean code passes all tests.</h4>
<p>You know your code is dirty when only 95% of your tests passed. You know you're screwed when your test coverage is 0%.</p>
<h4><i class="fa fa-shower" aria-hidden="true"/> Clean code is easier and cheaper to maintain!</h4>

    code cleaner, more efficient and easier to understand.

- en: A data class refers to a class that contains only fields and crude methods for
    accessing them (getters and setters). These are simply containers for data used
    by other classes. These classes don't contain any additional functionality and
    can't independently operate on the data that they own.

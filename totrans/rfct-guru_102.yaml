- en: Although it was planned to use a field universally for all classes, in reality
    the field is used only in some subclasses. This situation can occur when planned
    features fail to pan out, for example.

    of class hierarchies.

- en: When moving to several subclasses simultaneously, you can develop the fields
    independently of each other. This does create code duplication, yes, so push down
    fields only when you really do intend to use the fields in different ways.

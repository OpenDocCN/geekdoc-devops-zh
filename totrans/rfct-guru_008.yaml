- en: Bloaters are code, methods and classes that have increased to such gargantuan
    proportions that they're hard to work with. Usually these smells don't crop up
    right away, rather they accumulate over time as the program evolves (and especially
    when nobody makes an effort to eradicate them).

    ten lines should make you start asking questions.

- en: Refactoring helps you understand other people's code. If you have to deal with
    someone else's dirty code, try to refactor it first. Clean code is much easier
    to grasp. You will improve it not only for yourself but also for those who use
    it after you.

    fix simple problems quickly and gauge the time for fixing the more difficult ones.

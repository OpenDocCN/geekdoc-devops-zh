    certain circumstances. Outside of these circumstances, they're empty.

- en: Oftentimes, temporary fields are created for use in an algorithm that requires
    a large amount of inputs. So instead of creating a large number of parameters
    in the method, the programmer decides to create fields for this data in the class.
    These fields are used only in the algorithm and go unused the rest of the time.

    but for some reason they're almost always empty.

- en: Temporary fields and all code operating on them can be put in a separate class
    via [Extract Class](/extract-class). In other words, you're creating a method
    object, achieving the same result as if you would perform [Replace Method with
    Method Object](/replace-method-with-method-object).

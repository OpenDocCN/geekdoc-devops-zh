- en: At first a certain method was meant to be universal for all classes but in reality
    is used in only one subclass. This situation can occur when planned features fail
    to materialize.

- en: Such situations can also occur after partial extraction (or removal) of functionality
    from a class hierarchy, leaving a method that's used in only one subclass.

- en: If you see that a method is needed by more than one subclass, but not all of
    them, it may be useful to create an intermediate subclass and move the method
    to it. This allows avoiding the code duplication that would result from pushing
    a method down to all subclasses.

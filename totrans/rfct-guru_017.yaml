- en: If a subclass uses only some of the methods and properties inherited from its
    parents, the hierarchy is off-kilter. The unneeded methods may simply go unused
    or be redefined and give off exceptions.

- en: Someone was motivated to create inheritance between classes only by the desire
    to reuse the code in a superclass. But the superclass and subclass are completely
    different.

- en: If inheritance makes no sense and the subclass really does have nothing in common
    with the superclass, eliminate inheritance in favor of [Replace Inheritance with
    Delegation](/replace-inheritance-with-delegation).

- en: If inheritance is appropriate, get rid of unneeded fields and methods in the
    subclass. Extract all fields and methods needed by the subclass from the parent
    class, put them in a new superclass, and set both classes to inherit from it ([Extract
    Superclass](/extract-superclass)).

    the `Dog` class is inherited from the `Chair` class (even though they both have
    4 legs).

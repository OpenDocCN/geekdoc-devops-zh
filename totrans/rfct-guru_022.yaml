    added, making changes has become harder and harder.

- en: You may de-duplicate parallel class hierarchies in two steps. First, make instances
    of one hierarchy refer to instances of another hierarchy. Then, remove the hierarchy
    in the referred class, by using [Move Method](/move-method) and [Move Field](/move-field).

- en: Sometimes having parallel class hierarchies is just a way to avoid even bigger
    mess with program architecture. If you find that your attempts to de-duplicate
    hierarchies produce even uglier code, just step out, revert all of your changes
    and get used to that code.

- en: 'Often fields are moved as part of the [Extract Class](/extract-class) technique.
    Deciding which class to leave the field in can be tough. Here is our rule of thumb:
    **put a field in the same place as the methods that use it** (or else where most
    of these methods are).'

    place.

- en: If the field is public, refactoring will be much easier if you make the field
    private and provide public access methods (for this, you can use [Encapsulate
    Field](/encapsulate-field)).

- en: Decide how you will refer to the recipient class. You may already have a field
    or method that returns the appropriate object; if not, you will need to write
    a new method or field to store the object of the recipient class.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Replace all references to the old field with appropriate calls to methods in
    the recipient class. If the field isn't private, take care of this in the superclass
    and subclasses.
